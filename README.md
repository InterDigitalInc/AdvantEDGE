# AdvantEDGE
AdvantEDGE is a Mobile Edge Emulation Platform (MEEP) that runs on Docker & Kubernetes

> MEEP provides an environment to experiment with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technologies and edge / fog deployment models in short and agile iterations.

## Motivations
- [x] **Accelerate Mobile Edge Computing adoption**
- [x] **Discover new edge application use cases & services**
- [x] **Answer these questions:**
  * Where should my application components be located in the network?
  * What are network characteristics limitations of my application?
  * How will my application behave when the user moves in the network?

## Getting started
* [Setup runtime environment (Ubuntu/Dockers/Kubernetes/Helm)](docs/setup_runtime.md)

* [Deploy AdvantEDGE](docs/deploy.md)
<br/>in a nutshell:
  `
  ./deploy.sh -i
  `
* [Use AdvantEDGE](docs/use.md)
  * Quickstart with the Demo scenario
  * Deploy a scenario
  * Create your own scenario
  * Generate dynamic network events
  * Observe metrics
  * Advanced use cases
