------
AdvantEDGE is a Mobile Edge Emulation Platform (MEEP) that runs on Docker & Kubernetes.<br><br>

AdvantEDGE provides an emulation environment, enabling experimentation with Edge Computing Technologies, Applications, and Services.  The platform facilitates exploring edge / fog deployment models and their impact on applications and services in short and agile iterations.

## Motivation

- [x] **Accelerate Mobile Edge Computing adoption**
- [x] **Help Discover new edge application use cases & services**
- [x] **Help answer questions such as:**
  - Where should my application components be located in the edge network?
  - How do network characteristics (such as latency, jitter, and packet loss) impact my application or service?
  - How will my application behave when the user moves within and across access networks?
