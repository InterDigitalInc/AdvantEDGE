# AdvantEDGE
AdvantEDGE is a Mobile Edge Emulation Platform (MEEP) that runs on Docker & Kubernetes

> MEEP provides an environment to experiment with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technologies and edge / fog deployment models in short and agile iterations.

## Motivations
- [x] **Accelerate Mobile Edge Computing adoption**
- [x] **Discover new edge application use cases**
- [x] **Answer these questions:**
  * Where should my application components be located in the network?
  * What are network characteristics limitations of my application?
  * How will my application behave when the user moves around the network?

## Getting started
* [Pre-requisites (Ubuntu+Dockers+Kubernetes+Helm)](docs/setup.md)

* [Deploy AdvantEDGE](docs/deploy.md)
  ```
  ./deploy.sh -i
  ```
* [Use](docs/use.md)
  * Use the demo scenario (or create your own)
  * Deploy the scenario
  * Experiment!
