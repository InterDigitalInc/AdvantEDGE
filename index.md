**_What's New in v1.8.0!_**

:zap: **New edge native services:  [ETSI MEC011 - Edge Platform Application Enablement]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/edge-services/overview-edge-services.md %}#edge-platform-application-enablement-service) and [ETSI MEC021 - Application Mobility]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/edge-services/overview-edge-services.md %}#application-mobility-service) to boost up your edge apps! :rocket:**

:zap: **Improved metrics & storage with :earth_americas: [Geospatial network KPIs]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-features.md %}#geospatial-subsystem) and :card_file_box: [Metrics long-term storage]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-features.md %}#monitoring-subsystem)**

:zap: **General Maintenance fixes :hammer_and_wrench:**

:zap: **"_Old New_" :wink: you can still easily reach out to the team by initiating [:octocat: Discussion](https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/AdvantEDGE/discussions)**

## What is AdvantEDGE?
AdvantEDGE is a Mobile Edge Emulation Platform (MEEP) that runs on Docker & Kubernetes.

AdvantEDGE provides an emulation environment, enabling experimentation with Edge Computing Technologies, Applications, and Services.  The platform facilitates exploring edge / fog deployment models and their impact on applications and services in short and agile iterations.

### Motivation

- [x] **Accelerate Mobile Edge Computing adoption**
- [x] **Help Discover new edge application use cases & services**
- [x] **Help answer questions such as:**
<ul><ul>
<li>Where should my application components be located in the edge network?</li>
<li>How do network characteristics (such as latency, jitter, and packet loss) impact my application or service?</li>
<li>How will my application behave when the user moves within and across access networks?</li>
</ul></ul>

### Intended Users

- [x] **Edge Application Developers**
- [x] **Edge Network and Service Designers**
- [x] **Edge Researchers**
- [x] **Technologists that are simply interested learning how the Edge works**
