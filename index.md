## What is AdvantEDGE?
AdvantEDGE is a Mobile Edge Emulation Platform (MEEP) that runs on Docker & Kubernetes.

AdvantEDGE provides an emulation environment, enabling experimentation with Edge Computing Technologies, Applications, and Services.  The platform facilitates exploring edge / fog deployment models and their impact on applications and services in short and agile iterations.

#### Motivation

- [x] **Accelerate Mobile Edge Computing adoption**
- [x] **Help Discover new edge application use cases & services**
- [x] **Help answer questions such as:**
<ul><ul>
<li>Where should my application components be located in the edge network?</li>
<li>How do network characteristics (such as latency, jitter, and packet loss) impact my application or service?</li>
<li>How will my application behave when the user moves within and across access networks?</li>
</ul></ul><br>

#### Intended Users

- [x] **Edge Application Developers**
- [x] **Edge Network and Service Designers**
- [x] **Edge Researchers**
- [x] **Technologists that are simply interested learning how the Edge works**
