## Execution View
The Execution view provides a graphical interface to perform scenario run-time operations. You can use this view to deploy and terminate scenarios in the backend. You can also inject events to change the network topology or link characteristics.

Other views can be found in the [GUI Overview wiki page]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/usage/usage-gui-overview.md %})

---
## Headline Bar
This bar is always visible within the Execution view. It provides the following buttons:

### Sandbox

---
## Visualization Dashboard
This section is only visible when a scenario is deployed. It displays the views selected in the Dashboard configuration bar. Each view is described below:

### Network Topology
This view provides a visual representation of the network element hierarchy for the deployed scenario. It is updated whenever a scenario is deployed, refreshed or terminated. It shows basic network element information such as type, name & network characteristics directly in the graph.

We use a 3rd party graphing tool called [vis.js](https://visjs.org/) to create a network view of the scenario elements. You can drag and zoom the network view using the provided controls or using your mouse click & scroll buttons. Hovering over a node or link in the graph will open an informative tooltip with details about the currently configured element state.

### Map View
This view provides a visual representation of the network element geographic positions on a map for the deployed scenario. It is updated whenever a scenario is deployed, refreshed or terminated.

We use a 3rd party mapping client called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to render map tiles. Physical location assets such as UEs, PoAs & Compute nodes are then overlaid on the maps using markers, circles and lines. You can drag and zoom the map view using the provided controls or using your mouse click & scroll buttons. Hovering over a marker displays its name, and clicking on a marker opens a tooltip with the asset name, position, range, end-of-path mode & velocity, when applicable.

### Network Metrics Point-to-Point
This view loads the Network Metrics Point-to-Point Grafana Dashboard in an iframe. This dashboard monitors the deployed scenario and provides some latency and traffic metrics between the configured source and destination nodes. It displays instantaneous measurements for round-trip ping time and UL & DL throughput, as well as a graph of these measurements over the last minute.

_**NOTE:** You must select both a source and destination node in the Dashboard configuration bar to visualize data in this view._

### Network Metrics Aggregation
This view loads the Network Metrics Aggregation Grafana Dashboard in an iframe. This dashboard monitors the deployed scenario and provides some latency and traffic metrics between the configured source and all other scenario application nodes. It displays graphs for round-trip ping times, UL & DL throughput measurements over the last minute. It also shows a table of events received by the backend.

_**NOTE:** You must select a source node in the Dashboard configuration bar to visualize data in this view._

### None
Disables the view, giving its frontend real-estate to the other view.

## Manual Event Pane
This pane is used to manually configure and send events to the backend in order to dynamically alter the currently deployed scenario. Once fully configured you may send the event using the _SUBMIT_ button or cancel the event using the _CLOSE_ button. The event response status is displayed below the _SUBMIT_ button after sending an event.

You may configure the following events:

### MOBILITY
This event moves a chosen network element to a new location in the network topology. The following options must be configured:

#### Target
Drop-down menu to select the network element to be moved.

#### Destination
Drop-down menu to select the parent network element where the target element should be moved. This list is filtered to display valid destinations according to the selected target element.

When destination is set to _DISCONNECTED_, 100% packet loss is set on the selected target element to simulate network connectivity loss.

### NETWORK-CHARACTERISTICS-UPDATE
This event provides network characteristics that must be applied to a specific network element. The following options must be configured:

#### Network Element Type
Drop-down menu to select the type of network element to be updated.

#### Network Element
Drop-down menu to select the network element to be updated.

#### Latency / Latency Variation / Packet Loss / Throughput
Number fields to input element network characteristics to be sent in the event. Network characteristics are described in more detail [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/overview-architecture.md %}#network-characteristics).

### SCENARIO-UPDATE
This event dynamically adds or removes terminal, edge or cloud applications in the network topology. This event enables the [Process Lifecycle feature]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-process-lifecycle.md %}).

The following options must be configured:

#### Action Type
Drop-down menu to select the action to perform.

##### Adding an element
When adding an application, element configuration fields must be filled before submitting the event. Frontend & backend validation is performed on the event to prevent errors during process instantiation. Once successfully submitted, the platform performs all necessary actions to start the new application.

##### Removing an element
When removing an application, the target _Process Type_ & _Process Name_ must be selected from the drop-down menus. Once successfully submitted, the platform performs all necessary actions to stop the selected application.

### PDU-SESSION
This event adds or removes terminal PDU Sessions. This event enables the [Cellular Connectivity Control feature]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-cell-connectivity-control.md %}).

The following options must be configured:

#### Action Type
Drop-down menu to select the action to perform.

#### Terminal
Drop-down menu to select the terminal.

#### PDU Session ID
Text Field to input PDU Session ID.

#### Data Network Name
Drop-down menu to select the data network name (only visible when creating a new PDU Session).

---
## Automation Pane
This pane is used to enable/disable GIS automations. More details on GIS automations can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-gis.md %}).

### Movement
Toggles UE movement according to their respective paths.

### Mobility
Toggles automatic generation of mobility events.

### PoA-in-Range

---
## Replay Event Pane
This pane provides the following controls for replay file execution in the backend:

### REPLAY FILE
Drop-down menu to select the replay file to execute.

_**NOTE:** New replay files created while this pane is open will only be added the the list after the pane is closed and re-opened._

### LOOP
Checkbox to enable replay file execution looping. If checked, the backend replay manager will run the selected replay file to completion, wait for 5 seconds and then restart the same replay file execution. It continues this loop until stopped.

### PLAY
Sends a request to the backend replay manager to start the selected replay file execution. While running, the following replay file status information appears in the Event configuration bar:
- Running replay file name
- Current event count / Total event count
- Time to next event / Remaining replay file execution time

### STOP
Sends a request to the backend replay manager to stop the selected replay file execution.

### CLOSE
Closes the auto-replay event pane.

## Process Status Table
This table is only visible when a scenario is deployed. It provides the execution status for applications in the deployed scenario. It is updated whenever an application pod state changes.

The table also provides details about ingress & egress service mappings for external applications. Ingress & egress service mappings are prepended with 'I:' & 'E:' respectively. More details on external node service mappings are provided in the [External Nodes]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview/features/overview-external-nodes.md %}) wiki page.
