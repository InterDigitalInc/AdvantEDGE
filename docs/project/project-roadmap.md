## Project Roadmap

The following features are considered & prioritized in "as-needed" basis

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value added KPIs | Platform provides new KPIs to allow application prototyping & experimentation |
| New ETSI MEC Services | Platform supports new MEC services; BWM (MEC015) as the primary target |
| Mobile Edge/Fog Nodes | Platform allows mobility of edge nodes with creation and destruction of containers |
| Model extension | Platform allows to model new network topologies and types |
| Improved VM support | Provide guidance on installing AdvantEDGE in VM environment |
| Multi-user isolation | Isolate user sandboxes |
| PoA Selection Algorithm | Improve algorithm to consider network KPIs |
| Edge/Fog Selection Algorithm | Improve "minimum hop-count" algorithm to consider network KPIs |
