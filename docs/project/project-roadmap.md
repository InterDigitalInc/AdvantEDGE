## Project Roadmap

The following features are considered & prioritized in "as-needed" basis

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Process Lifecycle Events| Platform allows to control a container lifecyle during a scenario execution |
| Value added KPIs | Platform provides new KPIs to allow application prototyping & experimentation |
| Scenario Validation | Platform provides scenario validation capabilities |
| New ETSI MEC Services | Platform supports new MEC services; WLAN API (MEC028) & BWM (MEC015) as the primary targets|
| Network Connectivity Events | Platform allows to control network connectivity between nodes at scenario definition & run-time |
| Mobile Edge/Fog Nodes | Platform allows mobility of edge nodes with creation and destruction of containers |
| Model extension | Platform allows to model new network typologies and types |
| Improved VM support | Provide guidance on installing AdvantEDGE in VM environment|
| Security improvements | Provide login/logout capabilities
| Multi-user isolation | Isolate user sandboxes
| Disconnected compute node | Support disconnected compute nodes (may be related to Network Connectivity Events)
| Metrics recording trigger | Start recording metrics on a user generated events
