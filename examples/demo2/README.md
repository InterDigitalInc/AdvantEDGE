# Demo2 

## Explore the Demo2 Scenario
The scenario is essentially the same as demo1 except that rather than using the GUI to define edge app elements content, it uses charts defined by the user

Refer to [demo1 for the details](../demo1/README.md)

> Note that the location of the userCharts must be absolute. In the example, the /home/englab/AdvantEDGE/examples/demo2/ location is assumed for the location of the user charts files. Modify accordingly based on your setup.
